This project is a simple and interactive ToDo App that allows users to manage their tasks effectively. The app enables users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) tasks, with data persistently stored in the browser's local storage.

Key Learning Areas:
Form Input Handling: Process and validate user inputs for task management.
Local Storage Management: Store tasks persistently across sessions using local storage.
CRUD Operations: Implement task creation, reading, updating, and deletion.
Event Listeners: Respond to user actions like adding, editing, and deleting tasks.
UI Element Toggling: Show/hide elements and update the UI dynamically based on task states.

This project helped reinforce my understanding of JavaScript and local data management.
